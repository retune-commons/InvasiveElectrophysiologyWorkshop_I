# ReTune Invasive Electrophysiology Tutorial I 

Provided by projects B03, C01 and INF

### what you will learn:
Ephys tutorial 1 shows on an entry-level how ECOG and LFP data are organized. Topics covered are:
* how explore data you recieve
* rearrange data in readable format
* plot channels
* find the sample frequency
* interpret some information (Stimulation state, medication state, stimulator model) and where to store these
* rewrite channel names
* how to do rereferencing of the signal
* save your data in Matlab, FieldTrip or SPM readable format
* convert your data to BIDS format (brainvision)
* explore the data in Python and use mne

### what you need:
#### MATLAB
For the first part, you will need Matlab2020b as we start with this script https://github.com/retune-commons/InvasiveElectrophysiologyWorkshop_I/blob/main/Tutorial_I_Import_and_rereference.m

The dependencies are:
* spm: https://github.com/spm/spm12
* wjn_toolbox: https://github.com/neuromodulation/wjn_toolbox
* FieldTrip: https://github.com/fieldtrip/fieldtrip.git
* MatLab Signal Processing Toolbox

#### Python
For the second part, you need jupyter notebook as we end the tutorial with this script https://github.com/retune-commons/InvasiveElectrophysiologyWorkshop_I/blob/main/Tutorial_1_import_and_rereferences.ipynbT

The dependencies are:
* mne tools https://mne.tools/stable/index.html, that can be installed using following command:
```python
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip  install mne
```
